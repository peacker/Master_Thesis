# master_thesis
Simple programs for factorization and discrete log I have used during my master thesis.  

- from terminal, cd into the folder "master_thesis"

- to compile ONE .java file (for example FileName.java) do
  ```
  mkdir bin
  javac -d bin source/FileName.java

  ```

- to compile ALL .java files do
  ```
  mkdir bin
  javac -d bin source/*.java

  ```
  
- to run one .class file (for example FileName.class) do
  ```
  cd bin
  java FileName
  ```
